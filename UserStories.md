Toby
Toby is a non-technical who believes he suffers from some type of post Coronavirus brain cell damage. He wants to visualize areas that might be signals of malfunction comparing to normal brain images.


Sam 
* Sam is a undergraduate student. They have been learning about Alzheimer's Disease and need to create a presentation on it. They want to show differences in the structure of the brain. They want a simple visualization but feel intimidated on where to start. 

Riley
* Riley is a researcher. They want to expose their mentees to brain imaging and have them interact with examples. 

Mike
* Mike is a neuroscience professor teaching a unit on Alzheimer's Disease. He wants to demonstrate how white matter connectivity deteriorates in AD compared to healthy controls. He needs a simple interface to generate these visualizations for his lectures. Mike is an AD expert but has no experience with diffusion imaging analysis.

Maria
* Maria writes about neuroscience for a general audience publication. She wants to create visuals for an article on Alzheimer's research. Maria needs to generate accurate brain images without going through weeks of neuroimaging training. She has science communication skills but no technical imaging background.

Alex
* Alex teaches AP Psychology and wants to introduce students to brain imaging techniques. They're looking for an accessible tool that can show real brain data without requiring students to install software or learn programming. Alex has strong teaching skills but limited technical background in neuroimaging.

Taylor (technical)
* Taylor runs a university neuroimaging core facility that preprocesses DTI data for multiple research labs. They need to demonstrate data quality to investigators and validate that tract extraction pipelines are working correctly across different studies. Taylor wants automated visualization reports showing tract-level metrics across groups. They're experienced with neuroimaging pipelines but need tools that generate shareable QC reports without custom coding for each project.

Jordan
* Jordan is a cognitive neuroscience PhD student writing their literature review on aging and cognition. They want to explore publicly available DTI data to better understand connectivity patterns reported in papers. Jordan has basic Python skills but finds existing neuroimaging software overwhelming and poorly documented.

Casey
* Casey is a data scientist collaborating with a neurology research group. They want to test multple glass brain models to identify which best highlights differences between patients and controls. Casey has strong coding skills but limited neuroscience background.
