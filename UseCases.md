# Identifying common use cases from UserStories and components

1. View brain connectivity
* User profiles: educators, students, science communicators, general public
* Components: data loader (?), visualization renderer, user interaction controller, web API. 


2. Compare brains (healthy vs. disease)
* User profiles: educators, students, science communicators
* Components (in addition to use case #1): 


3. Upload and visualize data
* User profiles: researchers, data scientists collaborating on brain projects
* Components: file uploader; preprocessing module/format checking module; visualziation configurator


4. Export brain images
* User profiles: science communicators, researchers, students
* Components: snapchot generator (?), option to generate summary report (?)


5. Validate Data Quality or Preprocessing Results (we might not get here by the end of the project)
* User profiles: technical researchers, neuroimaging staff
* Components: QC visualziers
